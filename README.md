## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- VSCode


### What I learned

This challenge was very difficult and tried a lot of things out for the first time:

- Writting HTML tables and styling them with CSS;
- Used ````ol```` for the first time;
- Kinda learned how to style ````li```` markers, albeit with a lot of difficulty and with a solution that I wasn't completely happy with;

### Continued development

I want to improve my code for Ordered and Unordered lists and styling them with CSS. My solution was messy and I wasn't able to indent the ````li```` markers like I wanted to.

My name is Vin√≠cius, but it might be easier to just call me Vi or Vini. I'm an undergraduate Graphic Designer.

Currently I'm dabbling into HTML/CSS on my free-time because it's genuinely fun and because it's a nice skill to have since I want to be able to work on Web-Design (although I'm more than aware that it's not a requirement in the slightest).
